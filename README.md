# TopNavigationBarDemo
The TabbedAppDemo is a dynamic Android application that showcases the seamless integration of modern UI components such as TabLayout and ViewPager2. The application's main interface consists of a series of tabs, each represented by a unique icon and text label. Switching between tabs provides users with a distinct fragment view, making navigation intuitive and visually appealing.

Key Features:

TabLayout: This enables a horizontal layout of tabs, with each tab corresponding to a unique fragment view.
ViewPager2: Facilitates horizontal swiping between fragment views associated with each tab.
Fragments: Each tab's content is represented as a separate fragment, allowing modular design and isolated logic for each section of the app.
Custom Tab Icons: Each tab showcases a custom-designed icon accompanied by a descriptive text label, enhancing the application's user experience.

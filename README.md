# TopNavigationBarDemo
This Android application demonstrates the use of a TabLayout in conjunction with ViewPager2 and Fragment to create a swipeable tabbed interface. Each tab represents a different section of the application, and the user can navigate between these sections by tapping on the tab or swiping left and right.

ViewPager2 is an improvement over the original ViewPager, providing better RTL (Right-to-Left) support, vertical scrolling orientation, and is built on top of RecyclerView, which means it reuses pages and is more memory efficient.

Fragments are used to encapsulate and display the content of each tab. This modular design allows for better code organization, easier debugging, and the possibility of reusing fragments in different parts of the app.
